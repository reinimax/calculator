My calculator-project for Odin.

I had quite a hard time figuring out the logic here. After some thinking the logic of the basic functionality got quite clear, but adding new functionality and fixing bugs tended to mess around with the code, making functions bigger and complicating the logic of the whole thing.
I also encountered some situations in which I was not sure how something should work. The "C"- and "+/-"-buttons especially gave me headaches. Should I allow the user to alter the number he has already entered after he clicked an operator-button? I tried that solution out but found it to be unintuitive (at least without a dedicated output-field that shows the whole calculation so far). Finally I settled with probably the easiest way out: disabling these buttons after an operator was clicked.
Some more thinking and planning before starting to code could have saved me much time. The logic/problem-solving in this project was far more challenging for me than the actual implementation.
On the high side, the CSS felt a lot easier than during the first few projects and I am quite pleased with the looks of the calculator.
By now, it should work just fine without major bugs. I leave it for now as it is.
